# OpenGL Graphics Programs
## This is for use at the University of Nevada, Reno CS 480/680 Graphics Class
Any students in that class follow the instructions at [**Github Setup**](https://github.com/HPC-Vis/computer-graphics/wiki/Github-Setup) to begin. This is part of the first assignment in the class and necessary for turning in assignments throughout the semester.
